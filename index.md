## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 5, part 1

    I really enjoyed this lab because we practiced how to use if statements which is an important part of coding. I also really like this lab because we used the make tool which made things easier and faster because it does the work for you. Another reason I liked this lab is because it uses some things we have learned previously in other labs, which makes it easier to understand.

* Lab 7

    I really liked this lab because of how it had parking rules. It felt like solving real life problems since we also have to deal with this in our daily lives. I mostly liked this lab because it felt like we're creating an application that can teach people how to park correctly.

* Lab 10

    I really like this lab because we had to work on it independently which felt different from the ones we had to groups. This lab felt more real because it used real data which made it more fun. Working with real county names and real population numbers was my favorite part about this lab because it was something new and we've never done it before.
